# PoPS Model Introduction in GRASS Using Jupyter Notebook

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ncsu-landscape-dynamics/pops-intro-grass-notebook/main?urlpath=lab/tree/pops-intro-grass-notebook.ipynb)

This is a Jupyter Notebook introducing Pest or Pathogen Spread (PoPS) model in GRASS GIS
using Python interface. The repository is intended to be used with
Binder, but the notebook can be used anywhere once the dependencies
are met. You will need to download the data and change the path to the data in the notebook.

## GRASS GIS and r.pops.spread versions

This repository is compiling GRASS GIS 8.4.1 and downloading latest
r.pops.spread from GRASS GIS Addons repository
when the Binder image is renewed
(after making any change in this repository).
